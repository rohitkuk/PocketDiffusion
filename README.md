# Pocket Diffusion 🚀🔬🧠

:pinched_fingers: Trying to implement some of the Stable Diffusion Concepts and Architectures

Pocket Diffusion is a PyTorch-based implementation of stable diffusion-based models. This repository aims to provide a basic implementation of diffusion models using PyTorch, allowing researchers and developers to experiment with and explore the capabilities of diffusion-based modeling.

Diffusion models have gained significant attention in the field of deep learning due to their ability to generate high-quality samples and perform tasks such as image synthesis, inpainting, and denoising. Pocket Diffusion offers a simple and accessible implementation to get started with diffusion models and understand their underlying principles.
